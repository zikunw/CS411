As a user, I want to make a post to contribute to the community by sharing related books or youtube videos.
The user will click onto the community and be presented with a form. The user will provide basic info such as the title
of the post, description and provide either a spotify or youtube link. Once the user makes the post, a post will be 
added into the community where all who can be in the community can see it.
