As a user who has sent out the blend link to their friend, I want to see a side-by-side comparison of spotify and youtube Blends. The spotify will contain songs from both users. Songs that they mutually listen to and songs that are unique to each user. The youtube blend compares the kind of genre each user watches, and similarly will compile a lists of videos of mutual genres/videos they both watch, and videos unique to each of the users.
