As an unlogged user, I want to log in to my account in order to access the web application and my data. In order to log in to the page, the user will have access to a form that asks for a username and password. The web application will authenticate the user through a 6-digit code in their email. If the userâ€™s 6-digit code is correct, the user will be authenticated and the user will be redirected to the home page.
