As a current user, I want to be able to link my Spotify and Youtube accounts so that I can set up my account and learn more about my music and video history in comparison to others. I want to only have to login once to both applications after account setup (per user story 1). For each application, I want to click a login button that will direct me to a page to either Youtube/Spotify’s external login page. Once logged in, I should be redirected to the original application. This user story will be done when I’m back on the home page and the application now has access to my information from both applications.
