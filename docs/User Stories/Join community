As a user, I want to join communities that I am interested in to see related spotify and youtube media.
The user is presented with some communities rightaway on the homepage, or they can click onto the join communities page
to search for a specific community. Once they search for a community, there is a join buttonn they can click and 
now be apart of that community. If the user is not logged in, they will be notified to the login first
