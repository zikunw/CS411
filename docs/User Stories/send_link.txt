As a current user, I want to send a Blend link to a friend so that we can see how similar our tastes in Youtube videos are. The user obtains the link and sends it via text or through social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, Messenger, etc. Once the friend clicks the link, it will bring them to a page to accept starting the blend with the original user. Once accepted, the blend process will begin. Itâ€™ll create playlists based on their mutual tastes.
